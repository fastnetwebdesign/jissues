For each element in the array the key is the path to the file, this file will get parsed by JHtml::_includeRelativeFiles, and the value for the key is an array of arguments that you would liked passed to JHtml::script or JHtml::stylesheet respectively.\r\n\r\nI modified JHtmlBehavior::modal as an example of how this new feature can be implemented. It makes a call to self::load(''modal''); to add the library to the document.\r\n\r\nWith the second commit: https://github.com/rcorral/joomla-cms/commit/bf71fa00ede7620c67367ae05a5b3d6dc7b410c5\r\nI added a Joomla plugin to register the jQuery library using the previous functions. It only registers the library if the plugin is enabled. It would be up to any Joomla extension to load it with the following code:\r\nJHtml::_(''load'', ''jquery'');\r\n\r\nThe reason for creating a plugin is to avoid all of the support that the Joomla team would have to do by supporting another JS library.\r\nI think this is a great solution for a problem that many developers have been trying to overcome for years.\r\n\r\nPlease review and comment.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRafael', 3, 0, 1, '2012-02-02 18:36:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/116.diff', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This may be due to the way I upgraded Joomla. I used the old method of extracting the Joomla update file, FTPing all the files and overwriting the old, I then logged into Joomla Admin and went to Extension Manager / Database / and clicked Fix. This seems to have worked in every regard, except Finder is not functioning (though I see it was installed via FTP under /components and /administrator/components.\r\n\r\nIf I type the following I can see com_finder from my Joomla 2.5.1 Admin Panel:\r\n\r\n/administrator/index.php?option=com_finder\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is showing the following error on the page:\r\n\r\nError loading component: com_finder, 1\r\nError loading component: com_finder, 1\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I am at a loss on how to get the plugins?

This is being done because Joomla currently loads all of the JavaScript files first, then loads all of the JavaScript declarations afterwards. If you load jQuery, then MooTools (or another file that pre-defines `$`), then call `jQuery.noConflict()`, it will not work: http://www.designvsdevelop.com/jquery-in-joomla-i-was-wrong/\n\nThis approach works, but it is sub-optimal as you have to incur the overhead of two HTTP requests. There are two workarounds we could pursue:\n\n* Manually add `jQuery.noConflict();` at the end of jquery.min.js. We would have to do this every time we update jQuery. This is what WordPress does.\n* Add new code to `JDocument` and `JDocumentRenderer` that would allow declarations to be added immediately before or after a script is loaded. (I believe @beat mentioned he had a pull request for this on the platform)\n\nAnother thing we may want to consider is adding an option in Joomla that will let you specify a CDN copy of jQuery to use in place of the local one.\n\n**UPDATE 4 June**: The latest commits now implement code in `JDocument` for "post script" functionality. This allows inline JavaScript to be added immediately after a linked script. These commits also make it possible to specify an alternative path through `JHTML::_(''behavior.jquery'')`. This alternate path can be another copy of jQuery on the server, or the full URL to a CDN copy.\n\n**UPDATE 18 June**: Prescript functionality has been added, exactly the same as "post script", just before the script loads instead of after.

There is no PHP method to know jQuery version being loaded.\r\n3. There is no management of conflicts between different versions of the javascript libraries\r\n4. It is a pull request at CMS level for PLATFORM feature ?\r\n\r\nFYI: These 3 problems were solved in Joomla Platform pull request here:\r\nhttps://github.com/joomla/joomla-platform/pull/736\r\n\r\nFinal solution should have best parts of each the 2 proposals merged imho.', '2012-02-03 15:58:55'),
(3799909, 116, 'AmyStephen', '@rcorral said "The reason for creating a plugin is to avoid all of the support that the Joomla team would have to do by supporting another JS library."\r\n\r\nInitially, when I read that comment, I was encouraged, assuming that meant the JS files would not be included with core, a position I very much support. However, after review, I see that the files are actually included which, in my thinking anyway, implies the same degree of support for jQuery as is provided for Mootools. \r\n\r\nI think your registration concept is on the right track, but not the plugin, nor the inclusion of jQuery. I''d encourage you to beef up the API a bit and include a version, as Beat is indicating. Then, make certain the API provides adequate interface for extension devs to determine whether or not files exist that can simply be reused, or the extension needs to load those files. Nothing more than that, though, IMO.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to see the administrator template bundling the UI layer with the CSS, etc., whether it''s Bootstrap and jQuery, or MTs and Mocha, it''s more of a frontend developer choice and a adopting a JS-agnostic goal to help keep those options open will be very helpful for Joomla users.

(3800023, 116, 'rcorral', 'Hi Beat,\r\n\r\n1. Could you explain more. I have included jquery and jquery.noconfligt the same way and have not experienced any problems.\r\n2. This could be added, although I didn''t think it was necessary, as the register function allows you to [override the previous value](https://github.com/rcorral/joomla-cms/commit/47e208d8468851df3775205dc5bc6126ac55853d#L0R68). This way developers can just add the jquery library from their extension, but not override it in case the jquery plugin is already enabled.\r\n3. Honestly, I don''t even this is necessary, it adds unnecessary overhead. Joomla doesn''t maintain old versions of other javascript libraries, nor does it allow you to load old versions of mootools. You are stuck with the version that it ships with, and I think that fine. It is best to keep up with the latest and greatest. As another note, jquery is much better about backwards compatibility than other libraries.\r\n4. The plugin would need to get accepted by the CMS, but I would also need to submit a pull request for the platform changes. I guess I need some guidance with what to do in this case.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRafael', '2012-02-03 16:54:19'),

And all of them have .min.js as convention.

Right now, the MooTools Boostrap port mentioned above is three patches behind the standard version of Bootstrap. Also, although we''re not using it in this case, the MooTools port of Backbone is currently one patch behind the standard version.\n\nAnother concern is that MooTools ports are often incomplete. This is the case with the Bootstrap port: the ScrollSpy functionality is not supported. I''m assuming that there''s more ported over than the http://anutron.github.com/mootools-bootstrap/ suggests, but it appears as though there may be quite a bit missing when you compare to the original.\n\nThe markup for MooTools Boostrap is also different from the original. MooTools Bootstrap uses data attributes to assign behaviors to HTML elements, where the original does not. Part of the advantage of using something like Bootstrap is that someone coming from outside of the Joomla world will be able to use a familiar tool immediately. When we break that by using a slightly different variant, we''re making it more difficult for people to adopt Joomla.\n\nFor these reasons, MooTools Bootstrap is not preferable.\n\nThis pull request makes it possible for jQuery and MooTools to properly coexist on the same page, so adding jQuery shouldn''t be a problem.', '2012-06-10 18:58:57'),

Besides, if we are using a popular CDN like Google''s to deliver the jQuery and MooTools JavaScript files then there is no point discussing performance. Since so many sites out there already use the same files from the same CDNs there''s a big chance that these files are already in the cache of the visitor''s browser cache. IMHO, we Joomla! extensions developers are causing a much bigger pain in the rear of webmasters and web visitors alike since each one of us has to load his own private, namespaced copy of jQuery on a page. Usually with a system plugin. On every page. Ugh! Having One True Solution(tm) for loading jQuery off a CDN would let us allow Joomla! users build faster loading sites while at the same time using all the power of mooTools and rapid development of jQuery.', '2012-06-10 19:12:24'),

You can use either with data attributes or without. (Kyle chose with BTW)\n\n@nikosdion \nI''m eagerly awaiting the complains of developers when the CMS ships an incompatible jQuery version ;) Look at wordpress where you end up with 2-3 jQuery versions when you''re unlucky. IIRC Beat mentioned he can''t update the jQuery version in Community Builder because CB plug-ins rely on it. I''m not totally against including jQuery into the core (I''m against using it in the core thou) I just hope people realize it''s not a magic bullet to solve their jQuery problems.\n\nAs for the performance question. The browser still has to execute two big libraries on each request (think mobile). As much as it pains me to say but it would make far more sense to just switch the complete thing to jQuery than to deal with two libraries.\n\nAs for the CDN argument, I''m not quite sold on that and hard stats are almost impossible to come by. Browser caches are by default surprisingly small (Opera 20MB, Firefox 50MB). Considering the different CDN providers, jQuery versions (21 hosted by Google by my count), etc. the chance it''s in the cache is certainly far higher than a local version but I''m not sure it''s as high as most people think it is. That''s not to say it''s not a good idea to use it - but I don''t think ti''s good enough to justify loading an additional 80KB.', '2012-06-10 19:55:53'),

I somehow managed to update all of my jQuery, most of which I have written over two years ago and can''t explain you how it works even if you held me at gunpoint. In other words, there is nothing impossible. It''s merely a question of ROI. If the net gain (faster site, less compatibility issues) outweighs the drawbacks (rewriting code, rare cases of workarounds to support multiple versions) developers will follow suit. If we were just negatively predisposed individuals we would have never worked on making our software compatible with Joomla! 2.x ;)\n\nRegarding performance. I have only used Joomla! websites on iPad 2, iPhone 4S and HTC Desire (1GHz single and dual core processors). In all cases the bottleneck on mobile is the download weight, especially on 3G connections due to the huge lag. All of my devices didn''t even blink parsing jQuery and mooTools. But, yes, if we could get Joomla!''s own JS to be jQuery based it would be slightly better.\n\nRegarding CDNs, I agree with you. But! The more sites using the same file from the same CDN the more likely is the browser caching the file. I will tell you my unscientific, very objective findings so far. Ever since I had Kickstart load jQuery off a CDN people have been telling me how much faster it is. It would be interesting to have analytics about that, but I have no idea where to look or start.\n\nIn any case, even if the cache was busted and we ended up loading one copy of jQuery during the user''s first visit it would still be better than the typical site I see today. In the typical site we have at least two extensions loading two different jQuery versions. In this case, 80Kb with a single HTTP request guaranteed to get cached in the following page loads is better than 2 * 80Kb HTTP requests which most usually won''t get cached because there is neither an Expires not an Etag header. Of course if someone is merely using stock Joomla! it will make the page slightly heavier, by 80Kb. Well, we do get the option, as extension developers, to choose whether we want to load jQuery, don''t we?', '2012-06-10 20:10:56'),
(6231497, 218, 'jlleblanc', '@realityking Thanks for the clarification on data attributes. I stand corrected.\n\nI believe the plan is to get as much of the frontend core JavaScript converted to jQuery as possible first. This way, MooTools won''t be required to load and can be pulled in on an as-needed basis. If we can get everything converted over to jQuery for Joomla 3.0, that would be ideal, but it might also be too aggressive of a timeline.\n\nLong term, MooTools will most likely continue to be available in core for legacy code, just pulled in only when necessary. Obviously, having two libraries load is not ideal, but we can make an effort to ensure it isn''t the norm.\n\nAnd yes, there will always be people out there shipping code relying on out of date versions of jQuery, no matter how much we beg for people to upgrade. There are indeed no silver bullets, but having one specific copy available in core will definitely encourage people to avoid including their own.\n', '2012-06-10 20:13:06'),

If the attribute is omitted, and the external resource link type does not have a default type defined, but the user agent would obtain the resource if the type was known and supported, then the user agent should obtain the resource under the assumption that it will be supported.\n\nUser agents must not consider the type attribute authoritative — upon fetching the resource, user agents must not use the type attribute to determine its actual type. Only the actual type (as defined in the next paragraph) is used to determine whether to apply the resource, not the aforementioned assumed type.\n```\n\nBy obtaining the actual type is not content sniffing meant but relying on the ``Content-Type`` header.\n\nFor the script element (which is more relevant because it gets trickier):\n```\nThe type attribute gives the language of the script or format of the data. If the attribute is present, its value must be a valid MIME type. The charset parameter must not be specified. The default, which is used if the attribute is absent, is "text/javascript".\n```\n\nAnd for information why content sniffing is not a good thing I recommend: http://www.h-online.com/security/features/Risky-MIME-sniffing-in-Internet-Explorer-746229.html', '2012-08-18 21:18:35'),

I''ll have no problem in submitting it to platform before merging this but can we finish the debate here? \n\nWhat about something like:\n\n		// Generate stylesheet links\n		foreach ($document->_styleSheets as $strSrc => $strAttr)\n		{\n			$buffer .= $tab . ''<link rel="stylesheet" href="'' . $strSrc . ''"'';\n			if (!is_null($strAttr[''mime'']) && (!$document->isHtml5() || ($document->isHtml5() && $strAttr[''mime''] != ''text/css'')))\n			{\n				$buffer .= '' type="'' . $strAttr[''mime''] .

For javascript maybe an in_array with all the javascript types commonly used (text/javascript is the default type in HTML5 but is marked as obsolete by IANA that recommends application/javascript ....that doesn''t work on IE9..... ). So for example something like:\n\n		// Generate script file links\n		foreach ($document->_scripts as $strSrc => $strAttr)\n		{\n			$buffer .= $tab . ''<script src="'' . $strSrc . ''"'';\n			$defaultMimes = array(\n				''text/javascript'', ''application/javascript'', ''text/x-javascript'', ''application/x-javascript''\n			);\n			if (!is_null($strAttr[''mime'']) && (!$document->isHtml5() || ($document->isHtml5() && !in_array($strAttr[''mime''], $defaultMimes)) ))\n			{\n				$buffer .= '' type="'' . $strAttr[''mime''] . ''"'';\n			}\n			if ($strAttr[''defer''])\n			{\n				$buffer .= '' defer="defer"'';\n			}\n			if ($strAttr[''async''])\n			{\n				$buffer .= '' async="async"'';\n			}\n			$buffer .= ''></script>'' . $lnEnd;\n		}\n\nThis will allow developers to remove types keeping the flexibility for use custom mime types.', '2012-08-18 23:56:17'),
